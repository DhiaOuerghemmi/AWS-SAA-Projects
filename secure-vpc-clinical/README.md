## Real-World Problem  
> Healthcare applications handling PHI must ensure **strict isolation**, **99.9% uptime**, and **auditability** (HIPAA Â§ 164.312). Classic single-VPC designs risk data exposure via broad egress and incur high NAT costs (~\$0.045/GB), while manual drift remediation threatens compliance.

---

## Existing Solutions  
1. **Single-VPC per Environment**
   - Utilizes NAT Gateway for Internet egress.
   - Requires manual security group updates.
   - Employs VPC Flow Logs directed to CloudWatch.

2. **Transit Gateway Hub-and-Spoke**
   - Offers centralized connectivity.
   - Reduces peering overhead.
   - Involves higher transit fees.

3. **Third-Party SDN Appliances**
   - Provides fine-grained micro-segmentation.
   - Introduces licensing and operational complexity.

## Proposed Solution  
A **Shared-Services VPC** centralizes NAT and Gateway Endpoints (S3, DynamoDB) for cost savings, peered to **Environment-Specific VPCs**. All infra is declared in **Terraform modules**, with **CI/CD**, **drift detection**, and **auto-remediation** for a fully compliant, scalable architecture.

---

## Detailed Architecture  

### ðŸ“¦ Modules  
### 1. Modular Terraform Architecture

- **Reusable modules**: `vpc`, `subnets`, `nat-gateway`, `flow-logs`, `shared-services`, `monitoring`.
- **Version-pinned providers**: Terraform `>=1.5,<2.0`; AWS provider `~>4.0`.

### 2. Shared-Services VPC

- **High-availability NAT Gateways** and **Gateway Endpoints** (S3, DynamoDB) to eliminate per-GB NAT charges.
- **VPC Peering** to dev/staging/prod VPCs for centralized egress and AWS service access.

### 3. Environment VPCs

- **Public & private subnets** across multiple Availability Zones for fault tolerance.
- **Layered security groups** (management, application, data) to enforce least-privilege networking.

### 4. Compliance & Automated Remediation

- **AWS Config Rules** (`vpc-flow-logs-enabled`, `restricted-cidrs`) with **AWS managed remediations** via Systems Manager.
- **Terraform Sentinel policies** in Terraform Cloud to block insecure changes before apply.

### 5. CI/CD & Drift Management

- **GitHub Actions** workflows:
  - `lint-validate.yml`: Terraform formatting and validation.
  - `terraform-plan.yml`: Generates and annotates plans.
  - `terraform-apply.yml`: Applies changes with manual approvals.
  - `drift-detect.yml`: Scheduled daily drift detection runs.

### 6. Monitoring & Logging

- **VPC Flow Logs** directed to CloudWatch Logs, then to Kinesis Firehose, and stored in S3 with 365-day retention.
- **CloudWatch Alarms** on NAT Gateway egress and Flow Log errors, notifying via SNS.

## ðŸ§— Challenges Faced

### 1. Navigating Complex HIPAA Regulations

Interpreting and implementing HIPAA's intricate and evolving guidelines posed significant challenges, especially in translating legal requirements into technical controls.

### 2. Balancing Security and Usability

Implementing stringent security measures without hindering user experience required careful planning to avoid friction and ensure compliance.

### 3. Managing Terraform State

Ensuring consistent and secure management of Terraform state files across multiple environments was critical to prevent configuration drift and maintain infrastructure integrity.

### 4. Ensuring Vendor Compliance

Working with third-party providers necessitated rigorous vetting to ensure their compliance with HIPAA standards, as any lapse could compromise the entire system's security posture.

### 5. Automating Compliance Checks

Developing automated systems for continuous compliance monitoring and remediation was essential to maintain adherence to regulatory requirements without manual intervention.
